# Background: Lära - Concept for AI-Assisted Learning - BETA version!!!! 

## I. Introduction to Lära 

Lära is a concept for leveraging existing Generative AI technologies to facilitate dialogue-based learning experiences. It proposes a framework for engaging learners in meaningful, adaptive conversations that promote deep understanding and metacognitive skill development, utilizing the capabilities of current AI language models. Central to Lära's design is the empowerment of learners to guide their own learning process, making decisions about the direction and nature of their interactions with AI.

## II. Theoretical Foundations

Lära's conceptual design is grounded in several key educational and cognitive theories:

1. **Dialogic Theory of Learning** (Wegerif, 2007)
   - Conceptualizes learning as occurring within a "dialogic space" created through interaction
   - Emphasizes how AI can expand and enrich this dialogic space, fostering critical thinking and deeper understanding

2. **Socio-cultural Theory of Learning** (Lantolf & Thorne, 2006)
   - Extends Vygotsky's work to include technology-mediated learning environments
   - Positions Generative AI as a cultural tool mediating learning processes

3. **Guided Participation** (Rogoff, 1990)
   - Describes how learners develop through participation in cultural activities
   - Informs how AI-assisted dialogues can guide learners, offering insights into the scaffolding process

4. **Cognitive Apprenticeship** (Collins, Brown & Holum, 1991)
   - Influences Lära's approach to using AI for modeling expert thinking and problem-solving strategies
   - Guides the implementation of fading support to promote learner autonomy

5. **Self-Regulated Learning** (Zimmerman, 2002)
   - Shapes strategies for developing learners' abilities to plan, monitor, and evaluate their own learning through AI-assisted dialogues

6. **Cognitive Load Theory** (Sweller, 1988)
   - Informs the design of interactions to optimize cognitive processing
   - Guides the implementation of strategies to manage intrinsic, extraneous, and germane cognitive load

7. **Schema Theory** (Piaget, 1952; Bartlett, 1932)
   - Influences the approach to organizing and presenting information to facilitate the construction and modification of mental schemas
   - Guides the design of learning experiences that build upon and challenge existing knowledge structures

8. **Information Processing Theory** (Miller, 1956; Atkinson & Shiffrin, 1968)
   - Informs the structuring of information presentation and retrieval processes
   - Guides the implementation of strategies to support effective encoding, storage, and retrieval of information

## III. Key Features of Lära

- Adapts the complexity and presentation of content to align with learners' cognitive processing capabilities and existing knowledge structures

## IV. Unique Aspects of AI-Human Learning Dialogue

Lära's approach to dialogue differs from traditional human-human interaction in several key ways:

1. **Turn-taking Dynamics**
   - Utilizes AI's capability for immediate responses and handling of extended, complex turns
   - Leverages AI's persistent attention and recall of previous interactions
   - Proposes flexible dialogue structures and pacing, controlled by the learner

2. **Prompt Engineering and Context Management**
